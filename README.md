# SNU Website

Sigma Nu CMU public website.

## Updating the site

It's a static website, there is one html file and one css file, figure it out.

## Repository Name

The repository name must be `sigmanuds.github.io` so the github page deploys as `sigmanuds.github.io` rather than `sigmanuds.github.io/<repo>`
