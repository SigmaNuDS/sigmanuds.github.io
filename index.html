            <div class="who-div">
            In 1869, inspired by a vision of a fraternity grounded in love, honor, and truth, James Frank Hopkins and a group of courageous men founded Sigma Nu at Virginia Military Institute. They sought to create a brotherhood that would provide not only friendship but also support for personal and moral growth. With a strong commitment to academic excellence and leadership, Sigma Nu quickly expanded its reach, establishing chapters across the nation and becoming the first national fraternity with a presence in Canada. Today, Sigma Nu continues to thrive as a testament to its founders' dedication, fostering the development of its members and making a positive impact on campuses and communities worldwide.

            Brotherhood is the strong connection that members of our fraternity, Sigma Nu, establish with their fellow brothers. It is the shared experiences, camaraderie, and heartfelt conversations that contribute to making the years spent in college and as part of Sigma Nu some of the most memorable in a brother's life. From experiencing constant support and friendship to having a space where one can authentically express themselves, Sigma Nu cultivates a profound sense of belonging for all its members. This sense of belonging becomes evident as our brothers actively participate in a variety of campus activities—whether it's sharing meals, studying together, working out, or simply spending time in each other's company. This collective spirit defines Sigma Nu and shapes it into a distinctive and special fraternity!
