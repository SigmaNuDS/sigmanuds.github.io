            In 1869, inspired by a vision of a fraternity grounded in love, honor, and truth, James Frank Hopkins and a group of courageous men founded Sigma Nu at Virginia Military Institute. They sought to create a brotherhood that would provide not only friendship but also support for personal and moral growth. With a strong commitment to academic excellence and leadership, Sigma Nu quickly expanded its reach, establishing chapters across the nation and becoming the first national fraternity with a presence in Canada. Today, Sigma Nu continues to thrive as a testament to its founders' dedication, fostering the development of its members and making a positive impact on campuses and communities worldwide.

            Brotherhood is the strong connection Sigmas make with their fellow brothers within our fraternity. It is the shared experiences, camaraderie, and heartfelt conversations that make joining Sigma Nu and being in college some of the most memorable years of a Sigma's life. From having constant support and friendship to a space where you can truly be yourself, Sigma Nu fosters a sense of belonging for all its members. This can be witnessed through our brothers engaging in various activities on campus - whether it's grabbing meals, studying together, working out, or simply hanging out.

            Welcome to the Delta Sigma Chapter of Sigma Nu at Carnegie Mellon University! Established in 1916, our chapter holds a significant place in the history of Sigma Nu on this campus. As one of the founding groups for buggy in 1920, we have a proud tradition of participating in this exciting event, which we continue to do with great enthusiasm to this day.
            <p>
            At Delta Sigma, we are dedicated to upholding the values of brotherhood, scholarship, leadership, and personal growth that define Sigma Nu. Our brotherhood is built on strong bonds, mutual support, and shared experiences that create lifelong friendships and a sense of belonging within the fraternity.

            We take great pride in being leaders both academically and socially. Our members are involved in a diverse range of activities on campus, from excelling in their studies to holding leadership positions in various student organizations. But it's not just about individual achievements; we believe in giving back to the community and making a positive impact. That's why our philanthropic events are dedicated to supporting St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a cause we are passionate about and committed to.
            <p>
            Through our dedication to excellence and our close-knit brotherhood, we strive to foster an environment where members can grow personally and professionally. The experiences and values instilled during our time at Sigma Nu serve as a solid foundation for success in all aspects of life.
